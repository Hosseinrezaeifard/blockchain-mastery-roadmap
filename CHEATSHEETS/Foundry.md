1. **💡 `vm.startBroadcast()`** 
    
    In **Foundry's scripting system**, when you write a deployment script (inheriting from `Script.sol`), Foundry does **not actually send transactions** to the network **until you explicitly tell it to**.
    
    That’s what `vm.startBroadcast()` does:
    
    > ✅ It tells Foundry: "From this point on, all operations should be real blockchain transactions (signed and sent from the broadcast sender)."
    > 
    
    👨‍💻 Before `startBroadcast()` — "Simulation Mode"
    
    Before `vm.startBroadcast()`, everything you write is **just simulated**:
    
    - You're **setting up data**.
    - You're **calling view functions**.
    - You're **creating instances of contracts in memory**, but **not on-chain**.
    
    ⛔ No real blockchain interaction is happening yet — it's as if you’re **dry-running** the logic.
    
    🚀 After `startBroadcast()` — "Real Transactions Begin"
    
    Everything after this line:
    
    ```solidity
    vm.startBroadcast();
    ```
    
    … is now **a real transaction** on the chain you're connected to (e.g., Anvil, Sepolia).
    
    This includes:
    
    - Deploying contracts
    - Calling payable or state-changing functions
    - Sending ETH
    
    Foundry uses the **private key** (set in your `.env` or passed via CLI) to sign and broadcast these transactions.
    
    ```solidity
    contract DeployFundMe is Script {
        function run() external returns (FundMe) {
            // Just simulation
            HelperConfig helperConfig = new HelperConfig();
            address feed = helperConfig.activeNetworkConfig().priceFeed;
    
            // Real blockchain interaction starts here
            vm.startBroadcast();
            FundMe fundMe = new FundMe(feed); // this is a real deployment
            vm.stopBroadcast();
    
            return fundMe;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ---
    
2. **💡 Storage Layout & Reading: Two Methods in Foundry**
    
    ✅ **Method 1: View Storage Layout (Compile-Time)**
    
    ```bash
    forge inspect <ContractName> storageLayout
    ```
    
    This gives you a **simple table** showing:
    
    | Name | Type | Slot | Offset | Bytes | Contract |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | s_addressToAmountFunded | mapping(address => uint256) | 0 | 0 | 32 | src/FundMe.sol:FundMe |
    | s_funders | address[] | 1 | 0 | 32 | src/FundMe.sol:FundMe |
    | s_priceFeed | contract AggregatorV3Interface | 2 | 0 | 20 | src/FundMe.sol:FundMe |
    
    📌 This layout tells you:
    
    - **Slot index** of each variable.
    - Their types and sizes.
    - Use this info to compute dynamic storage slots (like for mappings and arrays).
    
    ✅ **Method 2: Read Runtime Storage from Deployed Contract**
    
    ```bash
    cast storage <contractAddress> <slotNumber>
    ```
    
    or to explore visually:
    
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key <key> --broadcast
    cast storage <contractAddress>
    ```
    
    Which results in something like this:
    
    | Name | Type | Slot | Offset | Bytes | Value | Hex Value | Contract |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | decimals | uint8 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 8 | 0x...08 | MockV3Aggregator |
    | latestAnswer | int256 | 1 | 0 | 32 | 200000000000 | 0x...2e90edd000 | MockV3Aggregator |
    | getAnswer | mapping(uint256 => int256) | 4 | 0 | 32 | 0 | 0x...0000 | MockV3Aggregator |
    
    📌 This lets you:
    
    - **Inspect actual values** of each slot in storage on a live contract.
    - Especially useful for reading mapping values, arrays, and verifying slot locations.
    - Remember: **mappings and arrays store data in hashed slots**, so `cast storage` only shows you slots with direct values unless you compute dynamic keys.
    
    🔍 Key Differences You Noticed:
    
    | Feature | `forge inspect` | `cast storage` |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Source of Data | Static from compiled contract | Live from deployed contract on chain (e.g., Anvil) |
    | Shows dynamic structure? | No, just slot index for mappings/arrays | No, unless you provide hashed slot manually |
    | Shows actual value? | ❌ | ✅ (Hex and Decimal) |
    | Use Case | Layout planning, test writing | Debugging storage, inspecting after deploy |
    
    🧠 Bonus Tip: Reading Mapping or Array Storage
    
    If you want to read a specific value (e.g. `mapping(uint => int)[5]` at slot 4):
    
    ```bash
    cast storage <contractAddress> $(cast keccak "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004")
    ```
    
    ---
    
3. **💡 To run a smart contract on Anvil and interact with it (call its functions), follow these steps**
    
    ## 🔁 1. Start a Local Anvil Node
    
    ```bash
    anvil
    ```
    
    - It starts a local Ethereum node at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.
    - You'll get 20 funded test accounts with private keys.
    
    ## 🧱 2. Write & Compile the Contract
    
    Make sure your contract is in `src/` folder, e.g., `src/MyContract.sol`:
    
    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    contract MyContract {
        uint public number;
    
        function setNumber(uint _num) public {
            number = _num;
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Then compile:
    
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```
    
    ## 📜 3. Write a Deployment Script
    
    Create `script/Deploy.s.sol`:
    
    ```solidity
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    
    import "forge-std/Script.sol";
    import "../src/MyContract.sol";
    
    contract Deploy is Script {
        function run() external {
            vm.startBroadcast();
            new MyContract();
            vm.stopBroadcast();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## 🚀 4. Deploy to Anvil
    
    In a separate terminal (while Anvil is running):
    
    ```bash
    forge script script/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast
    ```
    
    This will deploy your contract to Anvil.
    
    **Tip:** Add `--private-key` from one of Anvil's accounts if needed, but by default, Foundry uses the first one automatically.
    
    ## 🔧 5. Interact With the Contract
    
    There are **two ways** to call contract functions:
    
    ### ✅ A. Call with `cast` (CLI tool)
    
    Let’s say your contract was deployed at address `0xabc...123`.
    
    ```bash
    cast call 0xabc...123 "number()(uint256)" --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
    ```
    
    Or call a function with arguments:
    
    ```bash
    cast send 0xabc...123 "setNumber(uint256)" 42 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
    ```
    
    > Get a private key from the Anvil output. All accounts are unlocked.
    > 
    
    ### ✅ B. Call via Another Script
    
    You can also write an interaction script:
    
    ```solidity
    contract Interact is Script {
        function run() external {
            vm.startBroadcast();
            MyContract myContract = MyContract(0xYourContractAddress);
            myContract.setNumber(123);
            vm.stopBroadcast();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Run it:
    
    ```bash
    forge script script/Interact.s.sol:Interact --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast
    ```

4. 🛠️ Foundry Deploying & Testing 
    
    ## 🚀 PART 1: Deploy to a Live Network (e.g., Sepolia)
    
    ### ✅ What:
    
    Deploy to a real testnet like Sepolia using your private key.
    
    ### ✅ How:
    
    1. Export secrets:
        
        ```bash
        export PRIVATE_KEY=0xyourprivatekey
        export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
        ```
        
    2. Deploy:
        
        ```bash
        forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol:DeployFundMe \
          --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
          --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
          --broadcast
        ```
        
    
    ## 🧪 PART 2: Deploy on Local Anvil (Default Dev Chain)
    
    1. In one terminal:
        
        ```bash
        anvil
        ```
        
    2. In another terminal:
        
        ```bash
        forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol:DeployFundMe \
          --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
          --broadcast
        ```
        
    
    > Use the default Anvil accounts/private keys shown in its terminal output.
    > 
    
    ## 🌐 PART 3: Simulate Sepolia Using Forking (With Just `forge`)
    
    ### ✅ What:
    
    Use `--fork-url` to simulate Sepolia locally **without running Anvil with `--fork-url`**.
    
    ### ✅ How:
    
    ```bash
    export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
    
    forge script script/DeployFundMe.s.sol:DeployFundMe \
      --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL \
      --broadcast
    ```
    
    > This starts a temporary forked Anvil under the hood and runs your script against it.
    > 
    
    ## ✅ PART 4: Testing Locally with Anvil (Speedy Unit Testing)
    
    1. Start:
        
        ```bash
        anvil
        ```
        
    2. Run tests:
        
        ```bash
        forge test
        ```
        
    
    > Ultra-fast and gas-free. Ideal for normal test-driven development.
    > 
    
    ## ✅ PART 5: Testing Against Simulated Real Network (Forked RPC)
    
    ```bash
    export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
    
    forge test --fork-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL
    ```
    
    > You can impersonate accounts, test real contracts, etc., without needing to spin up forked Anvil manually.

5. **🛠 Foundry Cheatcodes: `vm.deal`, `vm.prank`, `vm.hoax`, `vm.roll`, `vm.warp`** 
    
    ### 🔹 `vm.deal(address, amount)`
    
    Gives ETH to an address during testing.
    
    ```solidity
    vm.deal(alice, 1 ether); // alice now has 1 ETH
    ```
    
    ### 🔹 `vm.prank(address)`
    
    Fakes the next call to make it look like it came from `address`.
    
    ```solidity
    vm.prank(alice);
    contract.enter(); // msg.sender is alice
    ```
    
    ### 🔹 `vm.hoax(address)`
    
    Shortcut for `vm.deal + vm.prank`. Funds the address and sets `msg.sender`.
    
    ```solidity
    vm.hoax(bob);
    contract.buy(); // bob is msg.sender and has ETH
    ```
    
    ### 🔹 `vm.warp(timestamp)`
    
    Moves the block timestamp forward or backward.
    
    ```solidity
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 3600); // jump 1 hour forward
    ```
    
    ### 🔹 `vm.roll(blockNumber)`
    
    Changes the block number (simulates mining a new block).
    
    ```solidity
    vm.roll(block.number + 1); // move to the next block
    ```
    
    ### ✅ Cheatcode Summary Table
    
    | Cheatcode | What it does |
    | --- | --- |
    | `vm.deal` | Give ETH to an address |
    | `vm.prank` | Set `msg.sender` for the next call |
    | `vm.hoax` | Fund + set `msg.sender` |
    | `vm.warp` | Set `block.timestamp` |
    | `vm.roll` | Set `block.number` |
    
    ---
    
6. 🧪 `vm.recordLogs()` in Foundry – Testing Event Outputs
    - Use `vm.recordLogs()` to **start recording** all logs/events emitted during a test.
    - After calling a function that emits events, use `vm.getRecordedLogs()` to **fetch and inspect them**.
    
    🔧 **Typical usage**:
    
    ```solidity
    vm.recordLogs();
    myContract.doSomething(); // emits event
    Vm.Log[] memory logs = vm.getRecordedLogs();
    ```
    
    🧠 Useful when:
    
    - You want to **verify** that an event was emitted.
    - You want to **check event data**, especially when it’s not exposed otherwise.
    
    ---
    
7. **🛠️ Decoding `topics` from Events in Foundry Logs**
    
    When you record logs with `vm.recordLogs()` and then fetch them with `vm.getRecordedLogs()`, you get an array of `Vm.Log` structs. Each log contains a `topics` array.
    
    📌 **Important rule:**
    
    - `topics[0]` is **not an argument**.
    - `topics[0]` is the **keccak256 hash of the event signature** (i.e., it's the identifier of the event itself).
    - The **actual event arguments** (like `requestId`, `winner`, etc.) start from `topics[1]`, `topics[2]`, and so on (for indexed parameters only).
    
    ### ✅ Example:
    
    If your Solidity event is:
    
    ```solidity
    event RequestedRandomness(bytes32 indexed requestId);
    ```
    
    Then in test:
    
    ```solidity
    vm.recordLogs();
    raffle.performUpkeep("");
    Vm.Log[] memory entries = vm.getRecordedLogs();
    
    bytes32 requestId = bytes32(entries[0].topics[1]); // NOT topics[0]
    ```
    
    - `topics[0]`: `keccak256("RequestedRandomness(bytes32)")`
    - `topics[1]`: actual `requestId`
    
    ---
    
8. **🛠️ Foundry Testing vs Scripting – Best Practice Summary**
    
    ### ✅ **Scripts (`script/*.s.sol`)**
    
    Use when testing **live deployments** on:
    
    - Local Anvil (with `-broadcast`)
    - Testnets (Sepolia, Goerli, etc.)
    - Mainnet (with caution 😅)
    
    **Pattern:**
    
    ```solidity
    function run() external returns (MyContract) {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        MyContract myContract = new MyContract(...);
        vm.stopBroadcast();
        return myContract;
    }
    ```
    
    **Useful for:**
    
    - Simulating contract behavior after deployment
    - Using actual network state + addresses
    - Integrating with tools like **foundry-devops** (to fetch latest deployments)
    
    ### 🧪 **Tests (`test/*.t.sol`)**
    
    Use when testing **logic and behavior** in memory — fast, cheap, isolated.
    
    **Pattern:**
    
    ```solidity
    MyContract myContract;
    
    function setUp() public {
        myContract = new MyContract(...); // Fresh instance
    }
    ```
    
    **Whether Unit or Integration:**
    
    - 🟢 Use `new Contract()` in `setUp()`
    - 🟢 Use mocks for dependencies (or deploy multiple contracts directly)
    - ❌ Don’t use deploy scripts here
    
    ### ✅ TL;DR
    
    | Tool | Purpose | Use `run()`? | Use mocks/instances? |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | `forge script` | Deploy/test real contracts | ✅ Yes | ❌ (Real deployment) |
    | `forge test` | Fast logic testing (unit/integration) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
    
    You're all set. This kind of clarity in your mental model = dev power 💪
    
    ---
    
9. **🛠️ Using Mocks with Foundry: `forge test` vs `anvil` + Deployment Logic**
    
    ### 🧠 Context:
    
    When building and testing a decentralized stablecoin system like DSC, we rely on **mock contracts** (e.g. `MockV3Aggregator`, `ERC20Mock`) to simulate real-world tokens and price feeds. Understanding **how and where** these mocks are deployed is critical when switching between testing environments like `forge test` and `anvil`.
    
    ---
    
    ### ✅ Case 1: `forge test` – Ephemeral In-Memory Testing
    
    - `forge test` spins up a **temporary, clean EVM** for every test.
    - Mocks are **deployed automatically** using `new` (e.g., in `HelperConfig`).
    - There's **no need** to broadcast or manually deploy.
    - The test environment is **isolated**, fast, and reset on each run.
    
    > ✅ Best for unit tests and verifying logic quickly.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### ✅ Case 2: `anvil` – Persistent Local Devnet
    
    - Anvil simulates a local, persistent blockchain (like Sepolia).
    - Mocks are **not automatically deployed** — you must deploy them manually with `forge script --broadcast`.
    - If you don't deploy them, your contracts will lack needed external dependencies (e.g., price feeds).
    - You typically deploy these mocks once and **reuse their addresses** for further development and testing.
    
    > ✅ Best for integration testing, local frontend interaction, and simulating a long-lived environment.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### 🛡️ Logic in `HelperConfig` to Reuse Mocks
    
    ```solidity
    if (activeNetworkConfig.wethUsdPriceFeed != address(0)) {
        return activeNetworkConfig;
    }
    ```
    
    This is a **guard clause** that prevents redeployment of mocks on persistent chains (like Anvil).
    
    - It checks if the config already has a price feed address set.
    - If yes → mocks were likely already deployed → just reuse them.
    - If not → proceed to deploy mocks (`new MockV3Aggregator(...)`, etc.)
    
    > ✅ Prevents repetitive deployment, saves gas and keeps mock addresses consistent.
    > 
    
    ---
    
    ### 📄 Summary Table
    
    | Feature | `forge test` | `anvil` (local devnet) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Blockchain Type | Ephemeral (resets every run) | Persistent (like a real chain) |
    | Mock Deployment | Automatic via `new` | Manual via `forge script --broadcast` |
    | `HelperConfig` Use | Deploys fresh mocks on each run | Can reuse previously deployed mocks |
    | Guard Check | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Needed to avoid redeployment |
    | Good For | Fast, isolated unit testing | Realistic flows, local frontends |
    
    ---
    
    ### 🧠 Takeaway
    
    > When testing smart contracts, always match your mock deployment strategy to the environment:
    > 
    > - Use **automatic deployment** in `forge test`
    > - Use **manual + reusable deployment** for persistent chains like Anvil, guarded by checks like `if (wethUsdPriceFeed != address(0))`.

10. `vm.revertOnFailure(true)` — What It Does in Foundry
    
    ### 🔹 Summary
    
    `vm.revertOnFailure(true)` tells Foundry:
    
    > ❗ If any contract call fails (reverts) during a test and it wasn't expected, fail the test immediately.
    > 
    
    By default, Foundry ignores unexpected reverts unless you explicitly check for them. This can hide bugs.
    
    ### 🔹 Why It Matters
    
    When testing smart contracts — especially with fuzzing or integration tests — a call might **fail silently** and go unnoticed.
    
    Using `vm.revertOnFailure(true)` helps you catch these failures **automatically**.
    
    ### 🔹 Simple Example
    
    ```solidity
    contract Bank {
        function withdraw(uint amount) public {
            require(amount <= 100, "Too much!");
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Test without `revertOnFailure` (test passes even though withdraw fails):
    
    ```solidity
    function testWithdraw() public {
        Bank bank = new Bank();
        bank.withdraw(999); // This will revert, but Foundry ignores it
    }
    ```
    
    ### Test with `revertOnFailure` (test fails immediately):
    
    ```solidity
    function testWithdrawFails() public {
        vm.revertOnFailure(true);
    
        Bank bank = new Bank();
        bank.withdraw(999); // ❌ This will revert, and Foundry will fail the test
    }
    ```
    
    ### 🔹 TL;DR
    
    - **Without** `revertOnFailure`: Failing calls might go unnoticed
    - **With** `revertOnFailure(true)`: Any unexpected revert = test fails 🔥
