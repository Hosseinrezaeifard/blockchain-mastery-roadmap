# Blockchain Mastery Roadmap

Welcome to the comprehensive blockchain mastery roadmap! This repository contains a structured learning path to become proficient in blockchain development, smart contract security auditing, and DeFi protocols.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with [Phase 1](Foundational_Learning.md) for foundational knowledge
2. Follow the recommended courses for structured learning
3. Practice with CTFs and real-world projects

## 📚 Learning Phases

### [🧪 Phase 1: Foundational Learning](Foundational_Learning.md)
Gain a solid understanding of Solidity, Foundry, and smart contract development through hands-on projects.

### [🔐 Phase 2: Security & Auditing](Security_Auditing_DeFi.md) 
Learn vulnerability assessment, auditing methodologies, and security best practices for smart contracts.

### [⚙️ Phase 3: Assembly, EVM Opcodes & Formal Verification](Advanced_Topics.md)
Become a top 10% dev & auditor by mastering EVM internals, assembly programming and formal verification.

### [🎯 Phase 4: ZK Proofs, GMX Perpetuals](ZK_Proofs_GMX_Perpetuals.md.md)
Deep dive into DeFi protocols, perpetual trading systems, and real-world implementation patterns along with ZK Proofs.
